<h2><i>My Travel Vlog</i></h2><br><br>
<p>My travel story takes place in South America, back when I used to travel solo for months at a time.

    I was in my mid-20s, and even though I’d backpacked Europe, Southeast Asia, and China and had studied abroad in Australia, the mix of intense excitement and nerves I had leading up to my South America backpacking trip was different.
    
    And despite family and friends warning me that South America wasn’t a place for a solo female traveler, it ended up being my best trip ever and one of my life changing trips!</p><br><br>
